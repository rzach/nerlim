An updated Master Bibliography File for use with custom-bib

To use it, you need to have P. W. Daly's custom-bib package installed. It is part of TeXLive, but if you don't have it, it's available at http://www.ctan.org/pkg/custom-bib. The *makebst* script enables you to generate a BibTeX bibliography style file (.bst file) according to a large number of possible customization options. See the *custom-bib* documentation for details on how this works.

The file *nerlim.mbs* is derived from *merlin.mbs* ver. 4.33. When you run 

> latex makebst

to generate a custom .bst file, you can use it instead of *merlin.mbs*.

*nerlim.mbs* will generate .bst files that differ from *merlin.mbs*-derived .bst files as follows:

 - volume numbers are attached to journal titles by a tie, not a space.
 - there's an option to indicate multiple occurrences of the same author by whatever *\bibdash* produces.
 - a *book* with both an author and an editor will not produce an error, but instead will give the editor(s) after the title, in the same format as *incollection* and *inproceedings* editors are formatted.

Included in this repository also:

 - *opencourt.dbj*, a batch file to generate a .bst file according to Open Court specs.
 - *opencourt.bst*, said .bst, generated by running 'latex opencourt.dbj'
 - *opencourt.bib*, a test bibliography file
 - *opencourt.tex*, a test LaTeX file
